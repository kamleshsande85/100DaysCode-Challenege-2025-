Today's focus: Network Interface Monitoring & Management

Key Concepts Covered:
Continuous monitoring using SNMP and MIB-II
Interface performance metrics: link status, utilization, CRC errors, runts, giants, drops
Troubleshooting techniques: bandwidth testing, analyzing Ethernet frame structure
Admin vs. automatic interventions:
Administratively disabled interfaces (manual)
Error-disabled interfaces (auto due to issues like flapping, config mismatch)
Suspended state at interface activation (e.g., LACP mismatch)
Long-term adjustments in network design based on consistent interface stats
Visualized the entire process in a flowchart for better clarity and revision.

🚀 Day 64 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge 🚀
Today, I explored Subnetting and Supernetting in detail! 🌐💻

📌 I solved two subnetting problems:
 🔹 First Problem: Dividing a Class C IP into two subnets and calculating essential details like the first and last IP, subnet mask, and broadcast address.
 🔹 Second Problem: Merging two Class C IPs into a larger network and computing all necessary IP details.
Subnetting is a fundamental concept in networking, and solving these problems helped me strengthen my understanding of IP addressing, subnet masks, and network boundaries.
Here are the screenshots of my work 📸👇

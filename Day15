ðŸŽ¨ Day 15/100 - hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge ðŸš€
Today was all about creativity and design as I dove deeper into Figma to enhance my prototyping and UI/UX design skills! ðŸŒŸ

ðŸ”¹ Key Achievements:
Learned advanced techniques in Figma to create more dynamic and interactive prototypes.
Worked on new components and explored how to build reusable design systems for better consistency.
Experimented with design enhancements to improve the overall user experience.


Designing with Figma not only sharpens my technical skills but also helps me think critically about user-centric design principles. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how small tweaks in design can create such a big impact on usability and aesthetics!
Looking forward to applying these skills to real-world projects soon. ðŸš€

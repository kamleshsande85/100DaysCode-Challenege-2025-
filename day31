Excited to kick off a new project today – Tiptap Extension using React.js! 🎯
In Module 1, I implemented basic functionalities like:

✅ Commenting 🗨️
✅ Encrypting 🔒

There are a few functionality issues that I'll be addressing in the next module, but progress is progress! 💡

Stay tuned for more updates as I refine and enhance this project. Any suggestions or insights are welcome! 🚀

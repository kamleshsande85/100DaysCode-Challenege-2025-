🚀 Day 56 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode: Exploring Threat Intelligence Tools! 🔍💻
Today, I dived into OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tools used for security threat assessments and investigations. Learning how to gather and analyze information using these tools is a crucial skill in cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

🔹 Threat intelligence helps in identifying potential risks before they turn into real threats.
🔹 OSINT tools provide valuable insights into network vulnerabilities, digital footprints, and cybersecurity threats.
🔹 This hands-on learning experience has strengthened my understanding of how cyber professionals track and mitigate security risks.

Looking forward to applying these tools in real-world security assessments! 💡🔒

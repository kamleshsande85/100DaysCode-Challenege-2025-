🚀 Day 68 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode 🚀
Today’s learning session was all about network scanning, port analysis, and monitoring tools—crucial skills in cybersecurity and ethical hacking! 🔍

🔹 Key Takeaways from Today’s Learning:
✅ Network Scanning: Using tools like Nmap to detect open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
 ✅ Port Analysis: Identifying open, closed, and filtered ports to assess security risks.
 ✅ SOHO Networks (Small Office/Home Office): Understanding their structure, security challenges, and best practices.
 ✅ Monitoring & Security Tools:
 🔹 Wireshark – Packet analysis for deep network visibility.
 🔹 SolarWinds – Network management and monitoring.
🔍 Why This Matters?
🔹 Proactive Security: Scanning and monitoring help detect threats before they escalate.
 🔹 Threat Detection & Response: Logs and traffic analysis help identify suspicious activity.
 🔹 SOHO Network Security: Small office/home office setups are often targeted due to weaker security controls—monitoring tools play a vital role in safeguarding them.
💡 Next Steps:
I’ll be diving deeper into advanced scanning techniques, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and firewall configurations to enhance security measures.
Cybersecurity is a fascinating journey, and every day is a step closer to becoming an expert! 🚀
📢 Have you used Wireshark, Nagios, Splunk, or SolarWinds for network security? I’d love to hear your experiences!

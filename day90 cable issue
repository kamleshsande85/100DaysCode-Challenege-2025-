ðŸ”Œ Deep Dive into Networking: Fiber Optic vs. Copper Cables

Excited to share my learnings from Day 90 of my #100DaysOfCode journey! Today, I explored the fascinating world of network cablesâ€”understanding their types, standards, and best practices.
Key Takeaways:

âœ” Fiber Optic Cables â†’ Use light for data transmission (Single Mode vs. Multimode).
âœ” Copper Cables (Ethernet) â†’ Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a â€“ each with different speeds & use cases.
âœ” Common Issues â†’ Crosstalk (NEXT/FEXT), Attenuation, and termination errors.
âœ” Standards Matter! â†’ TIA defines cable categories, while IEEE sets Ethernet standards.
Whether you're setting up a home network or managing enterprise infrastructure, choosing the right cable is crucial!

🔥 Day 13/100 - hashtag#100DaysOfCode 🔥
Today was all about strengthening my foundation in cybersecurity principles! 💻🔐

Here’s what I covered:
✅ ISO/IEC 19249:2017: Explored five architectural principles (Domain Separation, Layering, Encapsulation, Redundancy, and Virtualization) and five design principles (Least Privilege, Attack Surface Minimization, Centralized Parameter Validation, Centralized General Security Services, and Error & Exception Handling). These principles provide a strong framework for designing secure solutions.

✅ Refreshed my understanding of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and DAD model (Disclosure, Alteration, Denial) — both crucial for managing and mitigating risks.

✅ Learned about practical security strategies like:
Defense in Depth: Implementing multiple layers of defense.
Zero Trust: Never assume trust, always verify access.
Shared Responsibility Model: In cloud security, responsibilities are shared between the provider and the customer, emphasizing collaboration for protection.

💡 Why this matters?
Understanding these principles not only helps in identifying vulnerabilities but also equips me to design systems that can withstand modern cyber threats.

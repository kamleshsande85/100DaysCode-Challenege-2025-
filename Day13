🔥 Day 13/100 - hashtag#100DaysOfCode 🔥
Today was all about strengthening my foundation in cybersecurity principles! 💻🔐

Here’s what I covered:
✅ ISO/IEC 19249:2017: Explored five architectural principles (Domain Separation, Layering, Encapsulation, Redundancy, and Virtualization) and five design principles (Least Privilege, Attack Surface Minimization, Centralized Parameter Validation, Centralized General Security Services, and Error & Exception Handling). These principles provide a strong framework for designing secure solutions.

✅ Refreshed my understanding of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and DAD model (Disclosure, Alteration, Denial) — both crucial for managing and mitigating risks.

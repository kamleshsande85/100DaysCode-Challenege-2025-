ðŸš€Day30 hashtag#100DaysCode Module 3 - Completed Project! ðŸš€
I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed Module 3 as part of my 100 Days of Code Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

In this module, I developed a fully functional Quiz Application that allows users to test their knowledge across various topics. The app includes features such as:

âœ… Multiple Quiz Categories â€“ General Knowledge, Science, History, Technology, and more.
âœ… Timed Quizzes â€“ Users can challenge themselves with time-based questions.
âœ… Leaderboards â€“ Compete with others and see who scores the highest.
âœ… User-Friendly Interface â€“ A clean and intuitive design for a seamless experience.

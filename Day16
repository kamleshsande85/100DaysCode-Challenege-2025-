🌟 Day 16/100 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode 🌟
Today was another productive day in my coding journey! 🚀
✅ I delved deeper into NIST 800-53 compliance best practices, learning about its control families and how they ensure the security and privacy of 

information systems.
✅ Explored the Incident Response category and the importance of media protection in safeguarding sensitive data.

✅ Learned the phase of mapping assets and permissions, a critical step in enhancing organizational security.

Every day is a step closer to mastering cybersecurity frameworks and understanding how they safeguard the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
💡 Knowledge gained today motivates me to aim higher tomorrow! 🌐

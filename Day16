ðŸŒŸ Day 16/100 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode ðŸŒŸ
Today was another productive day in my coding journey! ðŸš€
âœ… I delved deeper into NIST 800-53 compliance best practices, learning about its control families and how they ensure the security and privacy of 

information systems.
âœ… Explored the Incident Response category and the importance of media protection in safeguarding sensitive data.

âœ… Learned the phase of mapping assets and permissions, a critical step in enhancing organizational security.

Every day is a step closer to mastering cybersecurity frameworks and understanding how they safeguard the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

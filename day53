Today, I dived deeper into React and explored more about the MUI (Material-UI) framework! ðŸš€ I worked on refining the login & signup page and improving the user experience with styled components.

Every day brings new learnings, and Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills in real-world projects. Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll be starting my next moduleâ€”canâ€™t wait to see whatâ€™s next! ðŸ”¥

🔐 Day 80/100 – VLAN Hopping & Network Security 🚀

Today, I explored VLAN Hopping, a critical security vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass network segmentation and gain unauthorized access to other VLANs. Understanding these attacks is essential for securing network infrastructures!
Two Main VLAN Hopping Techniques:

🛑 Switch Spoofing – The attacker tricks a switch into thinking their device is another switch, gaining access to multiple VLANs.
🛑 Double Tagging – The attacker sends specially crafted packets with two VLAN tags, allowing them to “hop” between VLANs without proper authorization.

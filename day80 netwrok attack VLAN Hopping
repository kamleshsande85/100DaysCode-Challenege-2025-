🔐 Day 80/100 – VLAN Hopping & Network Security 🚀

Today, I explored VLAN Hopping, a critical security vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass network segmentation and gain unauthorized access to other VLANs. Understanding these attacks is essential for securing network infrastructures!
Two Main VLAN Hopping Techniques:

🛑 Switch Spoofing – The attacker tricks a switch into thinking their device is another switch, gaining access to multiple VLANs.
🛑 Double Tagging – The attacker sends specially crafted packets with two VLAN tags, allowing them to “hop” between VLANs without proper authorization.
How to Mitigate VLAN Hopping?

✅ Disable automatic trunk negotiation & manually configure trunk ports.
✅ Change the default native VLAN and enforce tagging for all VLANs.
✅ Implement Port Security, BPDU Guard, and VLAN access control lists (ACLs).
✅ Regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

🔎 Key Takeaway: VLAN Hopping is a real-world threat, but with the right configurations, we can prevent it! 🚀

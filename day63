🚀 hashtag#Day63/100: Deep Dive into Switching in LAN 🌐
Today, I explored packet switching in LANs and how data flows through different network devices. The image below illustrates how a packet travels from 192.168.10.100 to 172.16.12.101 through multiple routers and switches. 🔄

🔍 Key Learnings:
 ✅ MAC Address Changes: At each hop, the source & destination MAC addresses change while the IP addresses remain the same.
 ✅ Routing Across Networks: Data travels through multiple networks, transitioning from private to public IPs and back to private.
 ✅ Encapsulation & Decapsulation: Each router removes the old L2 (Data Link) header and assigns a new one for the next hop.
 ✅ Switching & Forwarding: Switches make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses, while routers use IP addresses.


📌 Why This Matters?
 Understanding switching and routing at this level is crucial for cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and network troubleshooting. Each packet carries valuable insights about network behavior, and mastering this knowledge can enhance security and performance optimization.

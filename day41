🔐 Day 41 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode – Deep Dive into Metasploit! 🚀
Today, I explored Metasploit, one of the most powerful penetration testing frameworks. Here’s what I learned:

🔹 Searching for Exploits & Modules – Finding Apache-related exploits and auxiliary modules.
🔹 Setting Global Variables – Configuring target IPs globally to streamline testing.
🔹 Payload Management – Understanding self-contained payloads (singles) and how to unset them.
🔹 Exploitation Phase – Executing exploits efficiently using the right commands.
🔹 SSH Brute Force Module – Using auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login by hdm (H.D. Moore) to test SSH authentication.
🔹 Running Exploits in the Background – Using job-based execution for persistent sessions.

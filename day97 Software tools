Network Diagnostic and Discovery Tools | day97/100
Today I demystified network monitoring tools - here's why every developer should understand them:

üïµÔ∏è 1. Wireshark - The Network Detective
Think of it as a "microscope for network traffic"
Captures every packet (data unit) flowing through your network
Reveals hidden problems: "Why is my app slow? Is the server not responding or is there network congestion?"
üîç 2. Nmap - The Network Explorer
Like "Google Maps for your network"
Scans all devices ("Hey, I didn't know this printer was on our network!")
Identifies open ports (digital doors) - crucial for security
ü§ù 3. CDP/LLDP - The Silent Communicators
Switches automatically share their info: "Hi neighbor! I'm Switch-5, VLAN 10, port 24"
Creates a self-updating network map (no manual documentation needed!)
üìä 4. Speed Testing - The Network Health Check
Like a "treadmill test for your internet connection"
Proves whether you're getting what you pay for from your ISP

Why This Matters to Developers:
Build better apps when you understand the network layer
Debug faster when you can isolate network vs code issues
Security starts with knowing what's on your network

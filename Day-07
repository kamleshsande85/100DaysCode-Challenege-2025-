🚀 Day 7 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge 🚀

Today, I dived deeper into HTTP and gained a solid understanding of some key concepts:

🌐 URL Structure: How URLs are structured and how they serve as the foundation of the web.

📋 Status Codes: Learned about various HTTP status codes like:

    400 Bad Request: When the server can't process the request due to a client error.
    401 Unauthorized: Authentication required for access.
    ...and many others!
🍪 Cookies: Explored how cookies work, their purpose, and how they manage user sessions and preferences.
💻 HTTP Methods:

    GET: Retrieve data.
    POST: Send data.
    PUT: Update data.
    DELETE: Remove data.

🔒 HTTP vs. HTTPS:

    HTTP: Data is sent in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception.
    HTTPS: Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring secure communication and protecting sensitive information.
To solidify my understanding, I also solved some labs focused on HTTP methods and real-world scenarios.

It's exciting to see how these fundamentals power the web and improve my skills as a developer and cybersecurity enthusiast!

🌟 Onward to Day 8! 💪

🚀 Day 7 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge 🚀

Today, I dived deeper into HTTP and gained a solid understanding of some key concepts:

🌐 URL Structure: How URLs are structured and how they serve as the foundation of the web.

📋 Status Codes: Learned about various HTTP status codes like:

    400 Bad Request: When the server can't process the request due to a client error.
    401 Unauthorized: Authentication required for access.
    ...and many others!

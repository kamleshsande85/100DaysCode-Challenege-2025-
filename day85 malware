🚀 Day 85 of #100DaysOfCode – Exploring the World of Malware! 🚀

Cybersecurity threats are everywhere, and today, I took a deep dive into malware, its types, and how it spreads. Malware is more than just a virus—it’s
a vast category of malicious software that includes worms, ransomware, trojans, keyloggers, adware, and rootkits.
🔍 Key Learnings from Today:

🔹 Viruses vs. Worms

    A virus requires user interaction to spread—like opening an infected email attachment.

    A worm is more dangerous because it self-replicates without human action.

🔹 Ransomware

    Encrypts files and demands payment (usually in cryptocurrency) to unlock them.

    WannaCry & Locky are infamous ransomware attacks that caused global damage.

🔹 Trojan Horses & Rootkits

    Trojan Horse disguises itself as legitimate software but delivers a malicious payload once installed.

    Rootkits are stealthy, embedding deep into the operating system, making them hard to detect and remove.

🔹 Keyloggers & Adware

    Keyloggers secretly record keystrokes, capturing sensitive credentials.

    Adware & Spyware bombard users with unwanted ads while tracking their online behavior.

🔹 Logic Bombs & Botnets

    A Logic Bomb activates under specific conditions, like a certain date or event.

    A Botnet consists of multiple infected computers controlled remotely by cybercriminals.
🔐 Malware Prevention Tips:
✅ Keep software and OS updated to patch vulnerabilities.
✅ Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading unknown files.
✅ Use strong antivirus and endpoint security solutions.
✅ Regularly back up important data to mitigate ransomware risks.

Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and learning about them is crucial for cybersecurity professionals and everyday users alike. Today’s session strengthened my understanding of how malware operates and how to prevent it. 🚀

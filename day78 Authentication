🔐 Day 78 of #100DaysOfCode – Understanding Authentication Concepts & Technologies 🔐

Today, I deep-dived into Authentication and its critical role in cybersecurity. The foundation of secure access lies in the AAA framework (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting), which ensures:
✅ Identification – Who are you? (Username/Email)
✅ Authentication – Prove your identity (Password/MFA)
✅ Authorization – What can you access?
✅ Accounting – Tracking user activity for security
Some key technologies I explored:

🔹 RADIUS & TACACS+ – Centralized authentication for networks
🔹 SAML – Single sign-on (SSO) for seamless access
🔹 LDAP & X.500 – Organizing users & devices in a directory service
🔹 MFA – Enhancing security with multiple factors (password, biometrics, OTPs)
Understanding these concepts is crucial for securing modern systems. Authentication isn't just about logging in—it’s about ensuring only the right people have the right access at the right time.

Excited to apply these insights to real-world security projects! 🚀

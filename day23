🌟 Day 23 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode 🌟
Today, I took a dive into the world of React.js! ⚛️
React is a powerful library for building user interfaces, and it was exciting to explore its component-based architecture and dynamic 
features. Here's what I covered today:
🌐 Setting up my first React project
🛠️ Understanding components, props, and state
🎨 Creating a simple, interactive UI
This is just the beginning, but I’m already inspired by the endless possibilities React offers for web development. 🚀

🔒 Day 83/100: #100DaysOfCode – Understanding Rogue Services in Cybersecurity 🔥
Today, I explored the critical security threats posed by Rogue Services, such as:

🚨 Rogue DHCP Servers – Can distribute incorrect IP addresses, disrupting network connectivity.
📡 Rogue Access Points & Evil Twins – Allow attackers to intercept sensitive data by mimicking legitimate networks.
🕵️ On-Path Attacks (Man-in-the-Middle) – Hackers position themselves between two devices to steal or modify data.
How to Defend Against These Threats?

✅ DHCP Snooping – Prevents unauthorized DHCP servers from assigning IPs.
✅ 802.1X Authentication – Ensures only trusted devices connect to the network.
✅ Encryption (HTTPS, VPNs) – Protects data from interception.
✅ Network Monitoring – Regularly scan for unauthorized devices.
Cybersecurity is all about staying ahead of the threats! Today’s learning reinforced the importance of proactive defense mechanisms in securing networks. 🚀

What security measures do you use to protect against rogue services? Let’s discuss! 👇

### **Understanding Rogue Services and On-Path Network Attacks**  

This document explains how **rogue services** (like unauthorized DHCP servers and rogue access points) pose security risks and how **on-path network attacks (Man-in-the-Middle)** exploit them. Let's break it down step by step:

---

## **1. Rogue DHCP Servers: How They Disrupt Networks**
### **🔴 The Risk**
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** is used to assign IP addresses automatically.
- If an attacker sets up a **rogue DHCP server**, it can:
  - Hand out **incorrect IP addresses** (causing connectivity issues).
  - Assign **invalid gateways** (preventing internet access).
  - Cause **duplicate IPs**, leading to network failures.
  
**Example Attack:**  
- Imagine a hacker connects a rogue DHCP server to your network.
- It starts assigning **fake IP addresses** to users.
- Now, users can’t communicate properly, and their traffic can be rerouted to the attacker.

### **✅ Mitigation (How to Prevent)**
1. **DHCP Snooping** – Ensures only trusted DHCP servers can send responses.
2. **Active Directory Authorization** – Only allows **approved DHCP servers** to assign IPs.
3. **Immediate Removal** – If detected, the rogue DHCP server should be removed, and devices must **renew their IPs**.

## **2. Rogue Access Points (APs) and Evil Twins**
### **🔴 The Risk**
- **Rogue APs** are unauthorized Wi-Fi devices connected to your network.
- Even **well-intentioned employees** can accidentally create them.
- If **improperly secured**, attackers can exploit them to gain unauthorized access.

**⚠️ Wireless Evil Twins:**  
- **Malicious APs** designed to mimic legitimate Wi-Fi networks.
- **Tactics Used by Attackers:**
  - Same **SSID (Wi-Fi name)** as a real access point.
  - Higher **signal strength** to attract victims.
  - Cloning **security settings** to appear genuine.

### **✅ Mitigation (How to Prevent)**
1. **802.1X Authentication (Network Access Control)** – Ensures only authorized devices connect.
2. **Regular Wi-Fi Scans** – Identify rogue access points in the network.
3. **User Awareness** – Employees should be trained **not to connect to unknown Wi-Fi networks**.

## **3. On-Path Network Attacks (Man-in-the-Middle)**
### **🔴 The Risk**
- When an attacker **positions themselves between two communicating devices**, intercepting and modifying data.
- **Common Techniques:**
  - **Evil Twin APs** (Capturing login credentials)
  - **ARP Poisoning** (Tricking devices into sending traffic to the attacker)
  - **Session Hijacking** (Stealing authenticated sessions)
  - **HTTPS Spoofing** (Redirecting users to fake websites)
  - **Wi-Fi Eavesdropping** (Monitoring unencrypted traffic)

### **✅ Mitigation (How to Prevent)**
1. **Encryption is Key!**  
   - **VPNs** – Encrypt all traffic between your device and a VPN server.
   - **HTTPS** – Ensures secure communication between browsers and websites.
   - **End-to-End Encryption** – Protects messages and calls from interception.

2. **Use Secure Wi-Fi Practices**
   - **Never connect to public Wi-Fi without a VPN**.
   - **Verify Wi-Fi SSIDs** before connecting.
   - **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to protect online accounts.

## **🔑 Key Takeaways**
✔ **Rogue DHCP Servers** can cause massive connectivity issues and should be prevented using **DHCP Snooping**.  
✔ **Rogue Access Points** (including **Evil Twins**) are a major wireless security risk, and **802.1X authentication** helps prevent unauthorized access.  
✔ **On-Path Attacks (MITM)** steal and modify network data, but using **encryption (VPN, HTTPS)** makes intercepted data useless to attackers.  
✔ **User Awareness is Critical** – Users should avoid **unknown Wi-Fi networks** and always check for **secure HTTPS connections**.

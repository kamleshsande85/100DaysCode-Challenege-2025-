🔒 Day 83/100: #100DaysOfCode – Understanding Rogue Services in Cybersecurity 🔥
Today, I explored the critical security threats posed by Rogue Services, such as:

🚨 Rogue DHCP Servers – Can distribute incorrect IP addresses, disrupting network connectivity.
📡 Rogue Access Points & Evil Twins – Allow attackers to intercept sensitive data by mimicking legitimate networks.
🕵️ On-Path Attacks (Man-in-the-Middle) – Hackers position themselves between two devices to steal or modify data.
How to Defend Against These Threats?

✅ DHCP Snooping – Prevents unauthorized DHCP servers from assigning IPs.
✅ 802.1X Authentication – Ensures only trusted devices connect to the network.
✅ Encryption (HTTPS, VPNs) – Protects data from interception.
✅ Network Monitoring – Regularly scan for unauthorized devices.

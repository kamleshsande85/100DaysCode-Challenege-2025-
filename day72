🔹 Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP): Every organization needs a solid DRP to ensure business continuity in case of failures or cyber incidents. Here's a quick breakdown of key components:
 
✅ RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Maximum time an application can be down before it impacts business.
 ✅ MTTR (Mean Time to Repair): Average time taken to fix a system failure.
 ✅ MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): Expected time between two system failures.
 ✅ Site Resiliency: The ability of an IT infrastructure to withstand and recover from failures.
🔥 Types of DR Sites:
 🏁 Cold Site: Basic infrastructure, takes longer to set up after disaster.
 ⚡ Warm Site: Partially configured with some essential services.
 🚀 Hot Site: Fully operational, minimal downtime in case of failure.
🛠 Validation Testing: Regular testing of the DRP ensures readiness for real-world scenarios.

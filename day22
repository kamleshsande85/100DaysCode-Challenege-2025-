Today, I focused on revising Java and started brushing up on JavaScript! 💻 These two languages are essential for any developer, and diving deeper into their concepts is always a rewarding experience.

While revising Java, I explored this amazing cheat sheet by CodeWithHarry. It’s a goldmine of quick references and tips for mastering Java. 📝 Highly recommended for anyone looking to strengthen their programming foundations!

Next up, I’m diving into JavaScript—excited to enhance my front-end skills and create something cool soon! 🎯

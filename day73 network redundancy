ðŸ”¹ Topic: Network Redundancy - Active-Active vs. Active-Passive

In networking, redundancy is critical for ensuring high availability and reliability. Today, I explored two key redundancy models:

âœ… Active-Passive:

    Two devices are installed, but only one operates at a time.
    If the primary device fails, the secondary takes over seamlessly.
    Constant communication ensures real-time synchronization.
    Simple and effective for failover scenarios.

âœ… Active-Active:

    Both devices operate simultaneously, sharing the load.
    More complex to design and manage, but improves performance.
    Requires monitoring and traffic balancing.
    Ideal for high-availability environments where uptime is crucial.

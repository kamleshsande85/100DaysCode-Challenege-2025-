 Day 81 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge!
Still grinding and growing 
💡 Today's Deep Dive:
✔️ Mastered Ethernet switching & MAC address tables
✔️ Explored MAC flooding attacks (and how to stop them with port security) 🚫💀
✔️ Hands-on labs in Cisco Packet Tracer—because theory alone isn't enough! 🛠️🎯

Every day, I’m stacking knowledge like switches in a data center! Consistency is key, and I’m showing up—one concept, one lab at a time.
  
Grateful for this journey and the amazing tech community pushing me forward! Let’s keep learning, building, and securing networks together! 💪🔌

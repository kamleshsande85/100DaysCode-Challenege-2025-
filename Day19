🎉 Day 19: 100 Days of Code Challenge 🎉
Today, I am excited to share that I have successfully completed the basics of Python! 🐍

In these 19 days, I’ve learned key concepts like:
Basic syntax
Print statements
Arithmetic operations
And much more!

It feels amazing to see my progress, and I’m looking forward to diving deeper into more advanced topics in Python.
It's been a wonderful journey so far, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to challenge myself each day. 💪

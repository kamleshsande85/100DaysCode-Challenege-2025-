💻 Day 17/100 - hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge 🔐
Today, I explored the fascinating concept of the Cyber Kill Chain and gained a deeper understanding of its role in cybersecurity operations. 🌐🚀

🔹 What I Learned:
The Cyber Kill Chain framework: its purpose and how it helps in identifying and mitigating cyberattacks.
Explored the seven stages of the Cyber Kill Chain:

1️⃣ Reconnaissance
2️⃣ Weaponization
3️⃣ Delivery
4️⃣ Exploitation
5️⃣ Installation
6️⃣ Command and Control (C2)
7️⃣ Actions on Objectives

Understood how each stage is exploited by attackers and how defenders can break the chain to secure systems.
🔹 Practical Application:
Solved a hands-on room related to the Cyber Kill Chain, applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.
This framework is an eye-opener, showcasing the importance of proactive defense mechanisms and situational awareness in cybersecurity. Every new concept strengthens my passion for this field! 🔒💡

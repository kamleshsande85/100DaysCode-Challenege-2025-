🚀 Day 38/100 hashtag#100dayscode - Mastering Passive Reconnaissance & OSINT! 🚀
Today, I explored passive reconnaissance, a crucial step in ethical hacking where you gather intel without directly touching the target—staying stealthy while collecting valuable data!

🔍 What I Learned:
✅ The power of WHOIS, nslookup, and dig for DNS enumeration
✅ How tools like DNSDumpster & Shodan reveal hidden insights
✅ The importance of OSINT in cybersecurity

These tools provide massive amounts of data when used effectively. Mastering them means unlocking a whole new level of reconnaissance!
What’s your go-to OSINT tool? Let’s discuss in the comments! 👇

ðŸš€ Day 82/100: #100DaysOfCode Challenge ðŸš€

Today, I deep-dived into ARP and DNS Poisoning Attacksâ€”two critical security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in network communication.
ðŸ”¹ ARP Poisoning (IP Spoofing): Manipulates the Address Resolution Protocol to intercept and modify traffic, enabling Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

ðŸ”¹ DNS Poisoning (DNS Spoofing): Redirects users to malicious websites by altering DNS records, often used for phishing and malware distribution.

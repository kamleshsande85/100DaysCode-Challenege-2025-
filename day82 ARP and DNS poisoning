🚀 Day 82/100: #100DaysOfCode Challenge 🚀

Today, I deep-dived into ARP and DNS Poisoning Attacks—two critical security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in network communication.
🔹 ARP Poisoning (IP Spoofing): Manipulates the Address Resolution Protocol to intercept and modify traffic, enabling Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

🔹 DNS Poisoning (DNS Spoofing): Redirects users to malicious websites by altering DNS records, often used for phishing and malware distribution.
🔐 Key Takeaways:
✅ ARP has no built-in authentication, making it a prime target.
✅ Attackers can use gratuitous ARP responses to redirect traffic.
✅ DNS poisoning can be executed via host file modifications, DNS server hacks, or MITM attacks.
✅ Combining ARP and DNS attacks creates powerful exploits for stealing data.
💡 Learning about these vulnerabilities reinforces why network security is crucial in cybersecurity & ethical hacking. Time to explore mitigation strategies next! 🔥

### ARP and DNS Poisoning Simplified Explanation  

#### **1. Spoofing – The Base of These Attacks**  
**Spoofing** means pretending to be someone or something else to deceive others. Examples include:  
- **Fake Websites** (look like real sites to steal information).  
- **Fake DNS Servers** (mislead users to wrong IP addresses).  
- **Fake Emails** (phishing attempts).  
- **Fake Caller IDs** (scammers showing fake numbers).  

Attackers use spoofing to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or manipulate communications.

### **2. ARP Poisoning (IP Spoofing)**
#### **How ARP Works (The Vulnerability)**
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) helps devices on a **local network** find each other's MAC addresses using IP addresses.  
- When a device needs another device’s MAC address, it sends an **ARP Request**:  
  - “Who has IP 192.168.1.1? Tell me your MAC address.”  
- The correct device replies with its **ARP Response**:  
  - “I am 192.168.1.1, my MAC address is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX.”  
- The requesting device **stores** this information in its **ARP cache** for future use.  

👉 **Problem:** There is **NO** security check! Any device can send an ARP response and **lie** about its MAC address.

#### **How ARP Poisoning Works (The Attack)**
- The attacker **spoofs** (pretends to be) the router by sending a fake ARP Response:  
  - “I am the router (192.168.1.1), use my MAC address!”  
- The victim **believes** the attacker is the router and sends data to the attacker instead of the real router.  
- The attacker can now:  
  ✅ **Monitor traffic** (see everything the victim is doing).  
  ✅ **Modify traffic** (change messages, inject malware).  
  ✅ **Forward traffic** (continue sending data to the real router, making the attack harder to detect).  

💡 **This is called a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.**

### **3. DNS Poisoning (DNS Spoofing)**
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses. If this system is **compromised**, users can be redirected to **fake** websites.

#### **Methods of DNS Poisoning**
1️⃣ **Modifying the Host File (Client-Side Attack)**  
   - The host file on a PC **overrides** DNS settings.  
   - If an attacker **modifies** this file, legitimate sites can be redirected to fake ones.  

2️⃣ **Altering DNS Server Records**  
   - If an attacker gains access to a DNS server, they can **change IP records**.  
   - Example: Instead of google.com pointing to 142.250.190.14, it points to a hacker’s server.  

3️⃣ **Intercepting and Spoofing DNS Responses**  
   - If an attacker is already in the middle (using ARP poisoning), they can **respond faster** than the real DNS server with fake IP addresses.  
   - Example:  
     - Victim requests "www.bank.com" → Attacker replies with fake IP **before** the real DNS server does.

### **4. ARP and DNS Poisoning Together**
- Attackers **first use ARP poisoning** to become "in the middle" of the network.  
- Then, they **use DNS poisoning** to redirect victims to fake websites, phishing pages, or malware-infected servers.  

👉 **Example:**  
1. The victim tries to visit "paypal.com."  
2. The attacker **modifies** the DNS response to send them to a fake website.  
3. The victim unknowingly enters their login details on a **fraudulent** site.  
4. The attacker **steals** their credentials.  

---

### **5. Why These Attacks Work**
💀 **Lack of built-in security** in ARP and DNS protocols makes these attacks easy to execute.  
✅ **Defense Strategies:**  
   - Use **static ARP entries** (predefined MAC-IP mappings).  
   - Enable **Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)** on switches.  
   - Implement **DNSSEC** (DNS Security Extensions) to verify DNS responses.  
   - Use **HTTPS & Certificates** to prevent fake website logins.  

---

### **Conclusion**
ARP and DNS poisoning attacks show **how unprotected communication protocols** can be exploited. Understanding these attacks helps in securing networks against **MITM attacks, phishing, and data theft.**  

⚠️ **Key Takeaways:**  
✔ ARP poisoning = Spoofing router to intercept traffic.  
✔ DNS poisoning = Redirecting users to fake websites.  
✔ Combined = Powerful cyberattack for stealing data and spying on users.  
✔ Prevention = Secure network configurations, authentication, and monitoring.

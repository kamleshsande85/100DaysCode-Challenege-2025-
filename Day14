🔥 Day 14/100 - hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge 🔥
Today was packed with valuable insights into firewall technology and Kali Linux as part of my cybersecurity learning journey! 🔐💻
Key highlights of the day:

🔹 Firewalls:
Learned how firewalls work and why they are essential in securing networks.
Explored the types of firewalls (Packet Filtering, Stateful Inspection, Proxy, and Next-Generation) and their roles in filtering traffic.
Gained a hands-on understanding of firewall configuration to manage traffic and protect systems from unauthorized access.

🔹 Kali Linux:
Delved into Kali Linux, the preferred operating system for cybersecurity professionals.
Understood its purpose, tools, and why it’s used for penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and ethical hacking.

🔹 Cybersecurity Tools:
Explored powerful tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, and Nmap, and their applications in network analysis, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation.

🔹 Cybersecurity Policies:
Got a clear understanding of the importance of cybersecurity policies in protecting organizational infrastructure and data.

It’s amazing how every new concept is adding to my understanding of how cybersecurity works on a deeper level! 🌐💡
Excited to continue this journey and explore more! 💻🔐

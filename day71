ðŸš€ hashtag#Day71 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode â€“ Exploring ES6! ðŸš€
Today, I dived into ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and explored some amazing features that make JavaScript more powerful and readable. Some key takeaways:

âœ… let & const â€“ Block-scoped variables for better control
 âœ… Arrow Functions (=>) â€“ Shorter and cleaner function syntax
 âœ… Template Literals â€“ Easy string interpolation
 âœ… Destructuring â€“ Extract values from arrays & objects effortlessly
 âœ… Spread & Rest Operators â€“ Work with arrays & function parameters like a pro
 âœ… Classes & Modules â€“ Object-oriented approach & modular code structure
 âœ… Promises â€“ Asynchronous operations made easy

ES6 has truly changed the way we write JavaScript, making it more modern and efficient! ðŸ’¡

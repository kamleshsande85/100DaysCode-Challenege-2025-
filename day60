🔹 Day 60/100 : Exploring Active Directory Basics
Today, I explored Active Directory (AD) Basics on TryHackMe. Active Directory is a key component in managing enterprise networks, handling authentication, user/group management, and security policies. Understanding AD is crucial for cybersecurity, penetration testing, and IT administration.

💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Understanding AD structure (Domains, OUs, and Objects)
✅ How authentication works in Windows environments
✅ Importance of Kerberos and NTLM in security
✅ Basic enumeration and attack vectors in AD

🔍 As I continue my hashtag#CyberSecurity journey, learning AD fundamentals helps me build a strong foundation for ethical hacking, penetration testing, and network security.
Excited for the upcoming challenges! 🔥

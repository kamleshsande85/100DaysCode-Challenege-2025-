🔍 Debugging Network Performance Issues – Key Lessons!
Common Performance Killers & Fixes:

1️⃣ Bottlenecks: That one slow server/database dragging everything down? Solution: Monitor metrics (CPU, RAM, I/O) & optimize queries.
2️⃣ High Latency: Laggy API calls? Check: DNS resolution, server location, and CDN usage.
3️⃣ Packet Loss/Jitter: VoIP/video stuttering? Fix: QoS policies & bandwidth management.
4️⃣ Bandwidth Saturation: Congested links? Upgrade: NICs, switches, or use load balancers.
Realization: A fast app isn’t just about clean code—it’s about optimizing every layer (frontend, backend, network!).

🔧 Example: Reduced API response time from 1500ms → 500ms by indexing DB tables and tuning cache.

📌 Takeaway: Performance tuning is a mix of observation (logs/metrics), iteration, and patience.

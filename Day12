🌟 Day 12/100: DNS Demystified! 🌟

Today, I deep-dived into one of the most fundamental concepts of the internet: DNS (Domain Name System). It’s incredible how this invisible system works tirelessly behind the scenes to connect us to our favorite websites! Here's what I learned:

🚀 What is DNS?

DNS is like the internet’s phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) so computers can understand and communicate.

🧠 Types of DNS Levels:

    Root Level: The starting point for DNS queries, directing requests to the correct TLD server.
    TLD (Top-Level Domain): Handles domains like .com, .org, .net, etc.
    Second-Level Domain: The part of the domain name you register (e.g., example in example.com).
    Subdomains: Additional subdivisions of a domain (e.g., blog.example.com).


📝 DNS Record Types I Explored:

    A Record: Maps domain names to IPv4 addresses.
    AAAA Record: Maps domain names to IPv6 addresses.
    CNAME Record: Alias for another domain (e.g., www pointing to the root domain).
    TXT Record: Stores text-based information, often used for security protocols like SPF and DKIM.


🔍 What Happens When You Request a Website?

When you type a URL into your browser:

    The request checks the local DNS cache.
    If not found, it queries a recursive DNS server.
    The query goes through:
        Root Name Server 🡪 TLD Name Server 🡪 Authoritative Name Server.
    Finally, the server resolves the domain name to its IP address and connects you to the website

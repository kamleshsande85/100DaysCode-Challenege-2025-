ðŸŒŸ Day 12/100: DNS Demystified! ðŸŒŸ

Today, I deep-dived into one of the most fundamental concepts of the internet: DNS (Domain Name System). Itâ€™s incredible how this invisible system works tirelessly behind the scenes to connect us to our favorite websites! Here's what I learned:

ðŸš€ What is DNS?

DNS is like the internetâ€™s phonebook. It translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) so computers can understand and communicate.

ðŸ§  Types of DNS Levels:

    Root Level: The starting point for DNS queries, directing requests to the correct TLD server.
    TLD (Top-Level Domain): Handles domains like .com, .org, .net, etc.
    Second-Level Domain: The part of the domain name you register (e.g., example in example.com).
    Subdomains: Additional subdivisions of a domain (e.g., blog.example.com).

 #100DaysOfCode â€“ Day 92: Tackling Hardware Issues in Networking

Ever struggled with Power over Ethernet (PoE) or fiber optic transceivers? Hereâ€™s what I learned today:
ðŸ”Œ Power over Ethernet (PoE) Pitfalls:

    Not all PoE standards are equal! 802.3af (15W) â‰  802.3at (25W) â‰  802.3bt (71W).

    Pro Tip: Always check your switchâ€™s PoE budget before connecting devicesâ€”exceeding it can crash your network!

ðŸ“¡ Fiber Optic Woes:

    Mismatched transceivers? Say hello to signal loss!

        Multimode fiber (850nm) â‰  Single-mode (1310/1550nm).

    Power budget math is key:
    Copy

    Received Power (dBm) = Transmitted Power - Cable Loss  

    If your received power < receiver sensitivity (e.g., -20dBm), expect errors!

Lesson: Hardware isnâ€™t "plug and play"â€”compatibility and calculations matter!

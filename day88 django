🚀 #10DaysCode Challenge - Day 88 🚀

Today, I explored Django, its directory structure, and how it works! 🏗️💡

Django is a powerful Python web framework that follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern, making web development faster and more organized. I learned:
✅ The purpose of key files like settings.py, urls.py, views.py, and models.py
✅ How Django manages static files, templates, and databases
✅ The command-line tools that make development easier (django-admin, manage.py)

To solidify my understanding, I built a simple Django project where users can submit feedback, and it's stored in a SQLite database. This hands-on practice really helped me grasp the framework!
🔗 Excited to continue my journey with Django and explore more features like authentication, API integration, and security best practices.

Have you worked with Django before? Any tips for a beginner? Let’s connect! 💬💻

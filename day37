🚀 Day 37 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode – Active Reconnaissance & Networking Tools!
Today, I explored Active Reconnaissance, a crucial phase in cybersecurity that involves interacting with the target system to gather information. 🔍

💡 Key Commands Learned:
✅ ping – Check if a host is reachable 📡
✅ traceroute – Map the path of packets through networks 🌍
✅ telnet – Connect to remote systems and test open ports 🔌
✅ netcat (nc) – The Swiss Army knife for networking! Used for scanning, banner grabbing, and even reverse shells! 🛠️

🎯 Hands-on Practice:
I also solved rooms on TryHackMe, strengthening my skills in reconnaissance and network analysis.
Cybersecurity is all about learning, testing, and improving every day. Looking forward to diving deeper into ethical hacking and penetration testing! 🏴‍☠️

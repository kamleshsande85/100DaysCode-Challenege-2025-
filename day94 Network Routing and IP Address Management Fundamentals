🚀 #100DaysOfCode Challenge - Day 94: Demystifying Network Routing! 🌐

94 days of code, 94 days of breaking barriers! Today, I dove deep into network routing concepts—the backbone of how data travels across the internet! 💡
🔍 What I Learned:
✔ Routing Tables = Internet GPS 🗺️

    Routers use these tables to decide the best path for data packets (like choosing the fastest highway for your trip!).

    Missing route? Traffic gets dropped with an "ICMP Host Unreachable" error. Ouch!

✔ Default Gateway = The "Plan B" Route 🤝

    When a router doesn’t know where to send traffic, it uses the gateway of last resort (0.0.0.0/0)—like a safety net for lost packets!

✔ DHCP Drama: APIPA & Duplicate IPs ⚠️

    No DHCP response? Your PC panics and assigns itself a 169.254.x.x (APIPA) address—works locally but no internet for you! 😅

    Duplicate IPs? Chaos ensues! Pro tip: Always ping an IP before assigning it statically.
💡 Why It Matters:
Understanding routing helps troubleshoot why your Netflix won’t load (😉) and how enterprises manage global networks.

🙏 Shoutout:
To the tech communities & mentors who make complex topics like this easier to grasp! Onward to Day 95!

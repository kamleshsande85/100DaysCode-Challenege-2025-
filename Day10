ðŸŽ‰ Day 10 of #100DaysOfCode ðŸŽ‰

Today, I continued my journey with Figma and took my UI/UX design skills to the next level! Here's what I explored and accomplished:

âœ… Learned how to connect multiple pages in a design seamlessly.
âœ… Discovered how to add animations for interactive prototypes.
âœ… Mastered the process of sharing prototypes with others for review and feedback using collaboration features.

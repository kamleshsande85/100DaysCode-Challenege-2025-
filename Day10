ðŸŽ‰ Day 10 of #100DaysOfCode ðŸŽ‰

Today, I continued my journey with Figma and took my UI/UX design skills to the next level! Here's what I explored and accomplished:

âœ… Learned how to connect multiple pages in a design seamlessly.
âœ… Discovered how to add animations for interactive prototypes.
âœ… Mastered the process of sharing prototypes with others for review and feedback using collaboration features.

âœ… Explored testing designs on a mobile device using tools like the Figma Mirror Appâ€”a game-changer for real-time testing.
âœ… Collaborated with a team, gained insights, and improved my project based on their feedback.

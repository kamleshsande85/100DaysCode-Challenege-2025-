🔥 #Day50 of #100DaysOfCode – Learning IPTables Firewall! 🔥

Today, I explored IPTables, a powerful firewall utility in Linux used for packet filtering and network security. 🛡️ It allows administrators to define rules for allowing or blocking traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

    🔹 Key Features of IPTables:
✅ Controls inbound and outbound traffic
✅ Protects against unauthorized access
✅ Helps in setting up NAT (Network Address Translation)
✅ Can block specific IPs or allow only trusted connections

Excited to explore more firewall rules and security configurations. 🚀 If you have any tips or experiences with IPTables, drop them in the comments! 👇

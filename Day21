💻 Day 22: #100DaysOfCode 🚀
Today, I explored the Network Services room on TryHackMe to enhance my cybersecurity skills. 🔐
📌 Key Highlights:

Learned about SMB (Server Message Block) and its vulnerabilities, including how attackers exploit misconfigured shares.

Gained hands-on experience with enumeration tools like nmap and enum4linux to gather valuable information on open ports, services, and potential attack vectors.Practiced using smbclient for accessing SMB shares and uncovering sensitive files.

Started understanding Telnet protocol, its weaknesses, and why SSH is its secure replacement.

ðŸ”¥ Switching Issues & Loop Prevention in Networks ðŸ”¥

Today, I dove deep into network switching, learning why loops can crash a network and how Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) saves the day! Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:
ðŸ”¹ Why Loops Are Dangerous?
At the MAC layer, frames have no "timeout" mechanismâ€”theyâ€™ll loop forever until you unplug a cable! This can overwhelm switches and bring the network to a halt.

ðŸ”¹ How STP Prevents Disasters?

    Uses BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) to detect loops.

    Elects a Root Bridge (lowest Bridge ID wins!).

    Blocks redundant paths but keeps them as backups.

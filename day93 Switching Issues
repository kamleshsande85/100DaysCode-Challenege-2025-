🔥 Switching Issues & Loop Prevention in Networks 🔥

Today, I dove deep into network switching, learning why loops can crash a network and how Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) saves the day! Here’s a quick breakdown:
🔹 Why Loops Are Dangerous?
At the MAC layer, frames have no "timeout" mechanism—they’ll loop forever until you unplug a cable! This can overwhelm switches and bring the network to a halt.

🔹 How STP Prevents Disasters?

    Uses BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Units) to detect loops.

    Elects a Root Bridge (lowest Bridge ID wins!).

    Blocks redundant paths but keeps them as backups.
🔹 Common Pitfalls in Switching:
1️⃣ VLAN Mismatch → Devices can’t talk if ports are in different VLANs.
2️⃣ ACL Misconfigs → Accidentally blocking legit traffic? Always disable ACLs before editing!

💡 Key Takeaway: A well-configured STP + proper VLAN/ACL checks = Stable, loop-free network!

🚀 Day 96/100 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! 🚀

What I Learned Today:
Dived deep into Wireless Network Management—frequency interference, optimizing throughput, signal coverage, security risks, and seamless roaming. Key takeaways:
📡 Frequency Management:

    2.4 GHz (only 3 non-overlapping channels!) vs. 5 GHz/6 GHz (more channels, less interference).

    Auto vs. manual channel selection—critical for reducing overlap.

⚡ Optimizing Performance:

    Disable legacy protocols (like 802.11b/g) for better speed.

    Latest Wi-Fi standards (Wi-Fi 6/6E) = max throughput.

📶 Signal Coverage Tips:

    Use Wi-Fi analyzers & heat maps for dead zones.

    Adjust power levels, add external antennas, and minimize coax cable length.

🔒 Security Best Practices:

    Upgrade to WPA3 to prevent disassociation attacks.

    Consistent SSID & security settings across APs for smooth roaming.

Excited to apply these concepts in real-world networking setups! 💻🌐

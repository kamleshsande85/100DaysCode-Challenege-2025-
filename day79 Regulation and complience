Today, I continued my journey into cybersecurity by diving deeper into Regulatory Compliance (CompTIA Network+ N10-009 - 4.1). 📜🔐


💡 Key Takeaways:
✅ Regulatory compliance ensures businesses follow laws, policies, and security standards.
✅ GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) enforces data localization and gives users control over their personal data.
✅ PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) protects credit card transactions through strong security measures.

Failure to comply can result in fines, legal consequences, or loss of business operations. Staying compliant is crucial for maintaining cybersecurity in any organization!

🔍 As I continue my learning, I’d love to hear from you! Have you worked with GDPR, PCI DSS, or any other security compliance frameworks? Let’s discuss in the comments! 👇

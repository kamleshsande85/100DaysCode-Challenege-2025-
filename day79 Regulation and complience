✅ Regulatory compliance ensures businesses follow laws, policies, and security standards.
✅ GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) enforces data localization and gives users control over their personal data.
✅ PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) protects credit card transactions through strong security measures.

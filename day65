ðŸš€ Day 65 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode â€“ Wireless Network Configuration!
Today, I dived deep into Wireless Network Configuration and explored concepts like:

 âœ… Different types of antennas â€“ Omnidirectional & Directional
 âœ… IEEE Wireless Standards â€“ 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n
 âœ… 2.4GHz & 5GHz Frequency Bands â€“ Understanding channels, interference, and overlapping issues
 âœ… SSID (Service Set Identifier) â€“ The unique name for Wi-Fi networks
ðŸ“š Taking notes and experimenting with configurations helped reinforce my understanding of how wireless networks operate. This is crucial for Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking, where securing networks is a top priority.
ðŸ’¡ Learning wireless networking is an essential skill for every cybersecurity enthusiast! On to the next challenge.

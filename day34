ðŸš€ Day 34 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge(Module1:Teacher review Project) ðŸš€
Today, I made significant improvements to my Teacher Review Project by redesigning the GUI for a more polished and user-friendly experience. ðŸŒŸ

Key updates in Module 1:
Admin Page: Added functionality to manage everything smoothly.
Profile Page: Users can now view .

Looking ahead, in the next module, I will be adding the ability for users to update their information and introduce a Global Leaderboard, where every teacherâ€™s performance can be viewed and compared. ðŸ“Š
This has been an amazing learning experience, and I'm excited about how much progress I've made. Looking forward to continuing this journey of growth! ðŸ’»ðŸ”§

🚀 Day 51 of #100DaysOfCode Challenge! 🚀

Today, I continued my React.js journey and explored more about useState, props, and component interactions. ⚛️

🔹 Managed state effectively using useState
🔹 Passed and handled data between components using props
🔹 Worked on improving component reusability and performance

React keeps getting more interesting, and I'm excited to dive deeper into advanced hooks, state management, and optimization techniques! 🚀

Any tips or resources? Drop them in the comments! Let’s learn together. 💡

ðŸŽ¯ Achieved a 30-Day Streak! ðŸŽ¯
Super excited to hit a 30-day streak in my 100 Days of Code Challenge! ðŸš€ Today, I completed the Junior Security Analyst Intro room on TryHackMe, exploring the fundamentals of a Security Operations Center (SOC) and the role of a Junior Security Analyst.
Key takeaways from todayâ€™s challenge:
âœ… Understanding a day in the life of a Junior Security Analyst
âœ… Key responsibilities in a SOC environment
âœ… Steps to start a cybersecurity career
Staying consistent for the past 30 days has been a game-changer! The learning never stops, and Iâ€™m eager to continue pushing forward in my cybersecurity journey.

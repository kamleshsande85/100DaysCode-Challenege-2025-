🚀 Day 87/100 - #100DaysOfCode Challenge! 🚀

Another day of deep diving into network security! 🔥 Today, I focused on firewall rules, ACLs, URL filtering, security zones, and screened subnets (DMZs).
These concepts are fundamental for securing networks and preventing unauthorized access.
🔍 What I Learned Today:

✅ Access Control Lists (ACLs): Defined rules to allow or deny network traffic based on IP, ports, protocols, and time.
✅ Firewall Rule Processing: Firewalls process rules top-to-bottom, so specific rules should always come first!
✅ Implicit Deny Principle: If no rule explicitly allows traffic, it is automatically denied—a critical security measure.
✅ URL Filtering: Blocking unwanted or malicious websites using allowlists and blocklists.
✅ Content Filtering: Preventing data leaks, malware, and unauthorized content transfer across the network.
✅ Screened Subnets (DMZs): Creating a buffer zone between public and internal networks for web & email servers.
✅ Security Zones: Grouping different network segments into trusted, untrusted, and restricted zones for better access control.

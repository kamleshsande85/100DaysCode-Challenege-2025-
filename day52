🚀 Day 52 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode Challenge 🚀
Today, I started cloning Flipkart and worked on setting up the project structure, styling components, and fixing errors in React. It was a productive day, and I tackled several challenges along the way.

🔍 Key Takeaways:
✅ Setup Issues: Faced an error with @mui/material, but resolved it by checking dependencies and reinstalling the package.
✅ ESLint Warnings: Encountered unused variables in Searchbar.jsx, which I fixed by ensuring proper usage of styled components.
✅ Styled Components Debugging: Fixed CSS issues in styled(Box) components and corrected property names like text-align instead of text-aling.
✅ Navbar Implementation: Structured the navigation bar using mapped data and improved the layout.

💡 Next Steps:
Tomorrow, I will start working on the next module of the project, adding more functionality and refining the UI. Excited to continue this journey!

💡 It was a great learning experience, and I’m excited to build more features in the Flipkart clone. If you have any suggestions or resources, feel free to share! 🚀

Today, I explored Containerisation and its benefits! 🐳⚙️
Containers are revolutionizing how applications are built, deployed, and managed, making them more scalable, portable, and efficient.

Key takeaways from my learning session:
✅ Containers provide a lightweight and consistent environment across different platforms.
✅ They help in fast deployment and resource optimization.
✅ Tools like Docker and Kubernetes play a crucial role in modern DevOps.
This was an insightful session, and I’m excited to dive deeper into container security and orchestration next! 💡

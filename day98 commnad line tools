Command Line Network Tools | day98/100
🌐 Today, I dug into a suite of command-line network tools that are essential for mastering network troubleshooting. Here’s what I explored:

🔍 ping: Used ICMP to test if a device is reachable. It measures round-trip time and flags timeouts if a host isn’t responding—perfect for quick connectivity checks!

🛤️ traceroute/tracert: Traced packet paths to a destination, revealing each router hop with TTL-based ICMP messages. It’s great for pinpointing where network issues occur, though firewalls might hide some hops (hello, asterisks!).

📡 nslookup/dig: Queried DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses. dig is the modern go-to, showing A records and more, helping troubleshoot DNS issues like a pro.

📦 tcpdump: Captured live network packets on Linux/macOS, saving them in pcap format for analysis (think Wireshark compatibility). Filtering traffic makes it a powerful diagnostic tool.

📊 netstat: Displayed active connections, ports, and network stats. Options like -a (all connections) and -n (numeric IPs) helped me see exactly what’s communicating on my system.
⚙️ ipconfig/ifconfig/ip addr: Revealed local IP configs. ipconfig on Windows showed IPv4/IPv6 details, while ifconfig and ip addr on Linux/macOS listed MAC addresses and more—key for verifying network setups.

🔗 arp -a: Viewed the ARP cache, mapping local subnet IP addresses to MAC addresses. Pinging a device adds it to the cache, making this handy for identifying nearby devices.

Each tool brings unique insights to network diagnostics, and I’m loving how they work across Windows, Linux, and macOS! 💻 Onward to mastering the terminal!
